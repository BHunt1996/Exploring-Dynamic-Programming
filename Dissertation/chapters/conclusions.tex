\section{Evaluation \& Future Work}
Through this project I have achieved what I initially set-out to do, which was to explore a variety of dynamic programming problems which and in turn display the versatility of the dynamic programming method. Each developed Java program offers functionality that can assist in developing knowledge about the topic, as well as providing a basis to expand upon each problem by placing them individually within the scheme of a larger program. As shown through the documented applications of several of the problems, they can be implemented as a core algorithm within a specific project. As an example, the longest common subsequence problem could be expanded upon to be a program which reads in many DNA sequences and records all similarities between them.

For each problem, the documentation provided has the potential to further expanded. The aim for this documentation was to not get too deep in exploring the algorithm behind each problem, in order to keep the problems easy to understand and learn about. Specifically the mathematics can be explored in much greater detail, which is an alternate way to take this work and move away from the Java programming side of the project.
